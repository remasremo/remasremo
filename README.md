Once there was a speedy hare
who bragged about how fast he could run. Tired of hearing him boast, the tortoise challenged him to a race. All the animals in the forest gathered
To watch. The hare run down the road for a while and then paused
to rest. He looked back at the tortoise and cried out “How
do expect to win this race when you are walking along at
your slow paces?
The hare stretched himself out
alongside the road and fell asleep. Thinking,” There’s a lot of time to relax.” The tortoise walked and walked; never ever stopping until
she came to the finish line. The animals who were watching cheered so loudly that they woke up the hare. The hare stretched and yawned and run
again, but it was too late. Tortoise was already over the line.

The wolf and the sheep
One day a sheep was eating sweet grass away from
her flock of sheep. She didn’t notice a wolf walking
nearer to her. When she saw the wolf, she started
pleading “please, don’t eat me. My stomach is full of
grass. You can wait for a while to make my meat taste
much better. The grass in my stomach will be
digested quickly if you let me dance.” While the sheep
was dancing she had a new idea, “I can dance faster
if you take my bell and ring it so hard.”
The wolf took the bell and started to ring it so hard.
The shepherd heard the sound and ran quickly to save
the sheep’s life.
